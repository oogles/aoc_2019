Advent of Code 2019
===================

Each day's puzzle is found in the puzzles/ package, in a package named for the day it belongs to.
Puzzle input data should be added to an ``input`` file in that package.
Puzzle sample data should be added to a ``sample`` file in that package.
The puzzle solver should be created at ``puzzle.py`` in that package, as an instance of ``puzzles.aoc.Puzzle`` and named ``P``.

To run a solution, use the ``run.py`` script found in this directory.
E.g. For day 1:
    
    python3 run 1
