Advent of Code 2019
===================

Each day's puzzle is found in the ``puzzles/`` directory, in a subdirectory named for the day it belongs to, using the structure defined by https://github.com/oogles/aoc_base.

To run a solution for a given day, e.g. day 1, use::
    
    python3 run.py 1

To run all solutions, use::

    python3 run.py --all
